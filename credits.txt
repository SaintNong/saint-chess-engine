Temp file to track who to give credits to when the project gets a README.md

1. Pradu Kannan for very cool magic bitboards implementation
2. VICE from BlueFeverSoft for the general structure and process of building a chess engine
3. BBC from Maksim Korzh (Slava Ukraini!!) for very readable code from which I could decipher how bitboards work
4. Berserk, Ethereal, Xiphos, WyldChess for inspiration when I got stuck
5. the Chess Programming Wiki for demystifying many chess programming techniques (https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page)
